# gfx

A C++23 graphics rendering abstraction that models Vulkan's object model (instance, physical device,
device, queues, resources, commands, synchronization) above concrete backends. It is written with
C++ modules, strongly typed numeric handles and compile-time validated shader layouts.

> **Status:** step 0, the toolchain and build infrastructure. The library itself is added in later steps.

## Requirements (Windows)

| Tool | Version verified | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) UCRT64 GCC | 16.1 | GCC 15 or newer is required for `import std` |
| CMake | 4.4.0-rc2 | 4.3 or newer; see the `import std` warning below |
| Ninja | 1.13.2 | The only generator that can build `import std` |
| Python | 3.14 | Only for `build.py` |

Install the MSYS2 packages from an MSYS2 shell:

```bash
pacman -S --needed mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-{gcc,ninja,vulkan-headers,vulkan-loader,vulkan-validation-layers,glslang,spirv-tools,spirv-cross,vulkan-memory-allocator}
```

Dependencies that are not installed (or not usable, such as DLLs refused by Windows application
control) are downloaded and built with CMake's `FetchContent`. GoogleTest is always built from
source on Windows and linked statically.

## Project layout

└── tests/
    └── toolchain/        toolchain conformance tests (one subfolder per test suite)
```

## Building and testing

```bash
python builder/build.py --test
```

or, with CMake presets:

```bash
cmake --workflow --preset debug
```

Tests run in parallel through CTest (`ctest --test-dir build/debug --parallel`). Each GoogleTest
case is registered as its own CTest test.

## Warnings

- **`import std;` is experimental in CMake.** It is enabled through `CMAKE_EXPERIMENTAL_CXX_IMPORT_STD`,
  whose UUID changes with every CMake release. After upgrading CMake, configuration stops with an
  explanation; update the UUID table in `cmake/GfxImportStandardLibrary.cmake` or pass
  `-DGFX_IMPORT_STD_GATE=<uuid>`.
- **Windows Smart App Control**, when enforced, judges every freshly compiled executable and unsigned
  DLL by cloud reputation, and may block any of them unpredictably (test executables included). A
  blocked test fails with `execute_process Abnormal exit` or exit code `0xC0E90002`; the
  `Microsoft-Windows-CodeIntegrity/Operational` event log names the blocked file.
